# LEAF_Player
Simple audio player. C++, Forms, BASS and fmod libraries

The program was made by me in 2021 using the fmod and BASS libraries. 
When I created the program, I had a vague idea about OOP and programming in general, so the code is VERY bad 
(in debug mode it does not run now, and I donâ€™t understand some parts of it at all)
